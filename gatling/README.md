# Gatling Load Test

This example demonstrates a basic load test using [Gatling](https://gatling.io/), a powerful load testing tool based on Scala and built for high performance.

## 🔧 Prerequisites

### 1. Install Java JDK (8 or 11 recommended)
Gatling requires Java. You can install the JDK using one of the following:

#### On macOS (using Homebrew):
```bash
brew install openjdk@11


## Run the test
```bash
./bin/gatling.sh


## HTTP Reporting

Gatling generates detailed HTML reports including:

- Success/failure rates
- Response time percentiles
- Requests per second

📂 Reports will be saved under: results/<test-id>/index.html
